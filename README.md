## Cinema
Cinema is a web application designed to keep users updated on the latest trends in cinema, helping them discover movies, TV shows, or cartoons of their choice. The project is built with React and utilizes data from The Movie Database (TMDB).

## Functionality
The main page features a selection of currently trending movies.  
Users can click on a movie to access detailed information, including the cast and reviews.  
In the Movies section, users can search for movies, series, cartoons, and more.  
Pagination has been implemented to improve navigation through search results.  
Notifications appear when no search terms are entered or no results are found.  
The styling is handled using modular CSS (.module.css).
