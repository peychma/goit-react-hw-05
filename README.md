##Cinema
Cinema is a web application that allows users to learn about the latest trends in cinema and find the movies, TV shows, or cartoons they want. The project was implemented in React using data from the Movie Database (TMDB).

Clicking on a movie opens detailed information about it, including the cast and reviews.
On the Movies tab, you can search (find a movie, series, cartoon, etc.).
Pagination has been implemented for easy viewing of search results.
Notifications are displayed when the search is empty or there are no results.
CSS styling is implemented using modular CSS (.module.css).
